# Android MVP Architecture Sample Project(weather app)

* Retrofit
* Java
* RxJava
* MVP design pattern


Here is the example of Model View presenter (MVP) Pattern in android.
I develop a android application to show a weather data of a specific city, I used Dhaka. 


MVP Architecture is one of the most popular  to develop a maintanable and testable codebase. Develop a sample `Weater data showing` Android App with `MVP Architecture` using `Java` language and `Retrofit`library for network calling. Using Rx Java for asynchronous programming, know more about it (https://medium.com/@babul.sust.cse/what-is-reactive-programming-50514ded6e9)



### Application Description
Here is the example of Model View presenter (MVP) Pattern in android.
We have developed a android application to show a weather data of a specific city, I used Dhaka. User need to hit the `View Weather` button. Then App will send request to Open Weather web API and show the weather information in the UI.

### Open Weather API
We will use [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for collecting weather data. For getting weather information of a city, you need to sign up and get your own `APP ID`. Otherwise you can test the API with their sample `BASE URL` and sample `APP ID` without creating account.
